# Team Laptop Setup

We have a number of team laptops that we try to set up in a consistent fashion. Here's a checklist for installation of everything except the FRC-specific programming software. (That's covered on the [[Programming Environment Set Up]] page.)

* Get a USB drive with installers
  * Most of the installers mentioned below are available on a USB drive that Joe maintains
  * URLs are provided below in case the USB drive isn't available or is out of date

* Install Windows 10 Enterprise
  * Joe can provide an installation ISO deployed to a USB drive
  * The initial user should be "Girls of Steel" with the standard laptop password and no hint
  * Activate Windows (once every 120 days) http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/windows/activate.html
    * Must connect to a CMU wireless network or to a VPN that provides equivalent access
  * Set the timezone to US/Eastern
  * Set the 3504 background image
  * Task bar: Remove Cortana and Store, add Command Prompt (cmd), Settings, Control Panel, and items installed below

* Install Firefox http://firefox.com/
  * Add bookmarks to the Bookmarks Toolbar for important resources
    * GitHub http://github.com/GirlsOfSteelRobotics/Docs/wiki
    * FRC Javadocs http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/
